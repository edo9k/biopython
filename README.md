# Biopython

There's this free biopython course on Udemy, and I need to brush up on my python so... why the hell not, right?

I get one more certificate, learn little about some library I've never heard about in some area I didn't even know existed.

No one will ever read this. lol.

Oh, this is the free biopython course (in PT-BR): https://www.udemy.com/python_para_bioinformatica
